                    <p class="content">Moments are a collection of artworks i have designed over the years, they stand away from my portfolio or day 2 day design job but these are the pieces of work that make up me. The true moments of inspiration and creativity that happen for me. Looking back ive tried to recreate the methods or flow used to create these pieces but often they are lost. This is likely due to me being a huge stoner, but it makes me appreciate them,</p>

                    <p class="content">Always a battle. I just never full 100% confident when finishing a colour piece. Alot of my black and white work is done in colour until the final 10%. BW is my safety net. Ive promised myself to use colour more in my personal work. I envy(amjellyof) those who apply vibrant colours </p>
